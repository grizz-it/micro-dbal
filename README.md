# GrizzIT - Micro DBAL

A minimalist DBAL implementation ideal for projects requiring a small
implementation of database management.

## Adding a migration directory

In order to add a directory that contains migrations, add the following line:

```php
<?php

use GrizzIt\MicroDbal\Migration\MigrationManager;
MigrationManager::addMigrationsDirectory('directory/to/migrations');
```

## Adding a database connection

In order to create a new database connection, add the following line:
```php
<?php

use GrizzIt\MicroDbal\Connection\ConnectionManager;

ConnectionManager::addConnection(
    'master',
    [
        'dbname' => $_ENV['DB_DATABASE'],
        'user' => $_ENV['DB_USERNAME'],
        'password' => $_ENV['DB_PASSWORD'],
        'host' => $_ENV['DB_HOST'],
        'port' => $_ENV['DB_PORT'],
        'driver' => 'pdo_mysql',
    ]
);
```

The first parameter in this call determines the key of the connection.

## Retrieving a connection by key

To retrieve a connection by its key, use the following snippet:

```php
<?php

use GrizzIt\MicroDbal\Connection\ConnectionManager;

ConnectionManager::getConnection('master');
```

## Creating migrations

In the `migrations` directory, create a folder with the same name as the
configured connection required for the migration. Then add the migrations
anywhere inside that folder. Let the migration implement the interface
`App\Migration\MigrationInterface`.

The name of the file should always contain the date prefix:
`YYYY_MM_DD_HH_mm_SS_`. This part will be used for sorting the migrations.

After that the name of class inside the file must be defined as lowercase and
separated by underscores for words, e.g.: `CreateExampleTable` should be:
`YYYY_MM_DD_HH_mm_SS_create_example_table.php`. All migration names MUST be
unique.

### Default migrations
The `migrations` subdirectory is a reserved for running migrations that should
be run for every connection.

### Running migrations
Migrations can be run with the following snippet:
```php
<?php

use GrizzIt\MicroDbal\Migration\MigrationManager;

MigrationManager::runMigrations();
```
This will run all migrations (that have not been run) for all connections.

### Reverting migrations
To revert a migration, use the following snippet:
```php
<?php

use GrizzIt\MicroDbal\Migration\MigrationManager;

MigrationManager::revertMigration('2022_01_01_10_00_00_create_migrations_table.php');
```
